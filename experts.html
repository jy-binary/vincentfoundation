                    <h3>Prof. David Menon</h3>
                    <p>Prof David Menon obtained his PhD in 2006 from London University. He is a Principal Investigator in the Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, and Co-Chair of the Acute Brain Injury Program at the University of Cambridge. He currently acts as Vice-Coordinator of the CENTER-TBI project, a €30 million European multicentre study of precision medicine and comparative effectiveness research in TBI. His research interests include neurocritical care, secondary brain injury, neuroinflammation, and metabolic imaging of acute brain injury, using positron emission tomography and high field magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
                    <p>Research in his group has been supported by funding from several sources, including the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Medical Research Council, the European Commission’s FP7 Program, the Royal College of Anaesthetists, the Evelyn Trust, and the Wellcome Foundation.</p>
                    <p>Prof. Menon’s publications include the first in vivo demonstration of neuronal loss in clinical AIDS; the first fMRI study of drug effects on regional cerebral blood flow; the first use of functional imaging to document cognitive processing in the persistent vegetative state; demonstration of the impact of specialist neurocritical care on outcome in head injury; the first conclusive demonstration of regional ischaemia in head injury; the first documentation of diffusion barrier hypoxia as a pathophysiological mechanism in TBI; the current international definition of TBI; and the first validated use of [11C]PIB PET to image amyloid deposition in traumatic brain injury.</p>

                    <h3>Dr. Ralf Clauss</h3>
                    <p>Dr. Ralf Clauss is a Consultant Physician in Nuclear Medicine at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, UK. He completed his MBChB at the University of Pretoria and his MMed in Nuclear Medicine at the Medical University of Southern Africa. He completed his MD at the University of Düsseldorf in Germany and is a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in London. In 1999, together with Dr Wally Nel, he described a patient in the Vegetative State who regained consciousness on the medication Zolpidem, the first ever patient in the world to do so. Dr Clauss completed a 99mTc HMPAO SPECT brain scan on this patient and discovered the effect of Zolpidem on cerebral perfusion after brain damage. Together with Dr Nel and other colleagues, he continues to research the effect of Zolpidem on brain damage and also the role of neurotransmitter homeostasis after brain damage particularly that of oxygen based amino acids such glutamate and GABA, and monoamines such as dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Bock’s medical career has spanned more than 30 years. In addition to his medical practice, his professional activities included university hospital teaching positions, having served as Director of both Paediatric residency and Paediatric Nephrology fellowship programs at the Inova Fairfax Hospital for Children and Children’s Hospital National Medical Center, respectively. He also was a clinical and laboratory investigator throughout his career, and has published or presented nearly 100 peer-reviewed papers and textbook contributions. He has written or edited many medical manuscripts, research proposals, and public medical education media. Dr. Bock has recently retired from clinical medicine. With a very broad knowledge base and a passion for life-long learning, he is now devoting his time to editing and writing on numerous medical topics.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Bock received his medical degree from the University of Missouri – Columbia in 1975. He then served as a Paediatric resident at the State University of New York – Upstate Medical University, and completed a clinical and research fellowship in Paediatric Nephrology at the University of Minnesota Hospitals in Minneapolis. </p>

                        <p>Marcello Massimini MD, PhD is currently Associate Professor of Neurophysiology at the University of Milan. He worked at Laval University - Quebec (Canada) with dr. Mircea Steriade at the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Wisconsin (USA) with dr. Giulio Tononi, at the Coma Science Group of the Liege University (Belgium) with dr. Steven Laureys and he is currently Invited Professor the Center for Experimental Neurology (ZEN) of the University of Bern. His work focuses on identifying the neurophysiological factors that support complex interactions within the human brain in different conditions where consciousness may fade and recover, such as sleep, anesthesia and coma following brain injury. To this aim, over the last 10 years, he has implemented a novel approach to probe cortico-cortical communication and complexity at the patients’ bedside. The results of this work have been published on high-ranking journals such as Science, PNAS, Brain and Science Translational Medicine. Marcello Massimini has been the PI of several national and international project (FP6 EU grant, STREP, LSHM-CT-2005-518189; FP7 EU grant -PEOPLE-2007-4-3-IRG; FP7 EU grant, STREP, FP7-ICT-2007-2; FP7 EU grant, ICT – 2011-9, 600806; PRIN 2005 and 2010 from the Italian Ministry for University and Research), received different national and international prizes for his research and is a recipient of the James S McDonnel Scholar Award 2013 for the project “Consciousness and brain complexity: from theory to practice”. </p>

                    <p>Dr. Calixto Machado graduated as MD in 1976. He continued his medical training to become specialist in neurology and clinical neurophysiology, first degree in 1980, and second degree in 1984. In 1990 he became the youngest Dr. in Sciences in his country. Dr. Machado received clinical training in specialized neurology centers in Sweden, Italy, and Austria. During the last 30 years he has run many research protocols on subjects such as: brain death, coma, persistent vegetative states and other disorders of consciousness, stroke, autism, etc. He has published more than 160 peer reviewed articles, book chapters, and three books. His Book “Brain Death: A Reappraisal” was received with great enthusiasm among neurologists, neurosurgeons, intensivists, and physicians specialized in transplants.</p>
                    <p>In 1992, he was the first Cuban neurologist who was a member of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), nominated as a Corresponding Fellow. He has been the President of the Organizing Committee of the International Symposia on Brain Death, and the International Symposia on Disorders of Consciousness, since the nineties.  He has been awarded 10 times by the Best Annual Scientific Medical Research in Cuba. In 2005 he received the American Academy of Neurology “Lawrence McHenry Award” for excellence in neurology, and in 2011, he was awarded the “Researcher of the Year” by the International Academy for Child Brain Development (Phildelphia, USA), and by the International Association of Functional Neurology and Rehabilitation (Orlando, USA). These were the first time that a Hispanic neurologist, and a neuroscientist from a developing country, received those recognitions.</p>
                    <p>He is Senior Professor and Researcher at the Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Havana, Cuba. He is the President of the Cuban Society of Clinical Neurophysiology and of the National Commission for the Determination of Death. Dr. Machado is a Corresponding Fellow of the American Academy of Neurology, Chairman of the Network on Defining Death of the International Association of Bioethics, member of The World Federation of Neurology, and The International League Against Epilepsy.
